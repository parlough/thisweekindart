## Announcements

### Deprecations

Multiple deprecations to error types will be made in `dart:core`
alongside Dart 2.19:

- Deprecated `FallThroughError`. Has not been thrown since Dart 2.0.
- Deprecated `RangeError.checkValidIndex` in favor of `IndexError.check`.
- Deprecated `IndexError` constructor in favor of `IndexError.withLength` constructor.

You should remove and migrate all use cases
of these now deprecated classes and constructors.

## Language updates and discussion

This week saw the [patterns proposal][] be accepted
to be implemented in a future Dart version.
Beyond that, the [2.16 version][2-16-patterns] of
the patterns feature specification was released
updating the syntax of switch expressions
to eliminate `case` and `default`.

Beyond that,
the [1.1 version][1-1-sealed] of
the in-progress sealed types feature specification was released.
To avoid unnecessary breaking changes,
the `sealed` keyword is no longer a built-in identifier,
now relying on the context of preceding `mixin` or `class`.

To learn more about and contribute to discussion
of these and other potential changes to the Dart language,
visit the [Dart language repository][].

## Package of the week

The package of the week is [**mason_cli**](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli)
and the rest of the [mason ecosystem](https://github.com/felangel/mason).

`package:mason_cli` allows developers to create and consume
reusable templates called bricks.

The CLI tool has support for creating new bricks,
searching for existing breaks, installing and removing bricks,
and even bundling bricks like is done in [`package:very_good_cli`][].

To find or share bricks,
they even have a special site and platform,
[BricksHub](https://brickhub.dev/).

To learn more about the mason ecosystem and how to use the CLI,
see its [page on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli)
or Felix Angelov's [recent introduction at Flutter Vikings][mason-video].

Dart's package ecosystem is growing fast,
and we want to help foster that growth.
If you know of any great open source projects,
let us know by [suggesting a package][] on GitHub discussions.
