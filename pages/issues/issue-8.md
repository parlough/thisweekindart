to the Dart SDK in the past week.

The following are some handpicked, interesting changes:

* [[vm, gc] Prevent multiple threads racing to finalize marking from triggering an extra (synchronous) GC](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/baa870bfa734d02eee91192ac9c7c7ee0cb3b0ec)
* [[dart2js] Add deferred read/write path to serialization](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/3d35ae434cf795c29cc6b7a3190370e1838b2720)
* [[vm, gc] Apply incremental marking back-pressure in proportion to internal allocation size](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/2e4107c8aee8da6bd4c8173e0c130d873cc3b6cc)
* [Add quick fix for UNNECESSARY_FINAL](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/f9984c267b7b197e16fc5e639e274d63f792ba21)
* [[vm, compiler] Use RISC-V's compare-and-branch for a shorter write barrier sequence](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/0a8fda94b655079fe779f40a0a6076009d6217b8)
* [Deprecate `BidirectionalIterator`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/a08a5c5d6c41b301a34f5abb0d5232f8d41dd08d)
* [[analysis_server] ReplaceFinalWithConst to handle unnecessary `const`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/c979aa71d85df1cef37c2900d7f0d43068f9c00b)

_Keep in mind, none of these changes are guaranteed to
eventually land in a stable release._


## Language updates and discussion

Changes and improvements to the language specification
are continuously being discussed and implemented.

Recently, patterns and pattern matching have been explored as a solution
to some of the most commonly requests features and functionality.

To learn more and perhaps comment on patterns,
refer to the [Patterns Feature Specification][] 
and [Goals and Constraints][patterns-goals] documents.

One piece of the puzzle of patterns is the introduction of records,
a way to represent 
a series of positional fields and a collection of named fields.
This past week saw version 1.4 of the [Records Feature Specification][] released.

To learn more about and contribute to discussion
of this and other potential changes to the Dart language,
visit the [Dart language repository][].

## Package of the week

The package of the week is [**freezed**](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)!

`package:freezed` is a package for Dart that provides
code generation for immutable classes 
and has a simple syntax/API without compromising on the features.

freezed provides many features focused around
generating classes representing models,
including support for data classes, unions,
pattern matching, handled serialization, and more.

You can learn more about freezed,
how to set it up, and how to use it
on its [pub page][freezed-pub].

Dart's package ecosystem is growing fast,
and we want to help foster that growth.
If you know of any great open source projects,
let us know by [suggesting a package][] on GitHub discussions.

        <p>If you came from a Kotlin background, 
        there's not much you need to learn to be all caught up with Dart. 
        Like, there are so very few differences 
        that you can learn them while doing some actual work.</p>
