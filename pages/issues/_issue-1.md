Hello fellow Dartisans!
Welcome to the second issue of _This Week in Dart_!
_This Week in Dart's_ aim is to be a useful collection of changes and news
from across the Dart ecosystem and its surrounding community.

To contribute to this and future issues,
feel free to contribute on [GitHub][]
or suggest content for next week on [GitHub discussions][].

To discuss this week's issue,
feel free to join us on the [Unofficial Dart Community Discord][]
in the `#this-week-in-dart` channel.

## Announcements

This was an especially busy week for Dart as
Google I/O was this past week, May 11-12, available to stream online.

This year saw a lot of interesting content and announcements for developers
using Google products or services, including Dart 2.17 and Flutter 3.

To catch up with the Dart and Flutter announcements and learning materials,
see the [Flutter page][flutter-io] on the [Google I/O 2022][] site.

## Package of the week

The package of the week is [**rohd**](https://pub.dev/packages/rohd).

The Rapid Open Hardware Development (ROHD) framework
is a framework by Intel 
for describing and verifying hardware
in the Dart programming language. 
ROHD enables you to build and traverse a graph of connectivity
between module objects using unrestricted software.

Dart's package ecosystem is growing fast,
and we want to help foster that growth.
If you know of any great open source projects,
let us know by [suggesting a package][] on GitHub discussions.
